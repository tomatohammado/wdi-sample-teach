# Prompt

The following lesson prompt is an excerpt from Prototypes and
Inheritance in JavaScript.

By this stage, students should have experience with both
JavaScript and Ruby and will have Ruby-based OOP. They’ve used
JavaScript variables, functions, objects, and callbacks, but haven’t
worked with prototypes or constructors yet. Using the Lesson Plan
Template in this packet, prepare a 15-minute lesson on Prototypes.

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
• Demonstrate a use case that explains prototypal inheritance and
what kind of flexibility it gives to programmers
• Use namespaces to organize application code
• Define a custom constructor method that sets one or more
properties of a new object
